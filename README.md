| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| version_id | The ID of the uploaded file version on Nexus Mods |

## Usage

First, use another action to create a zip file. Then, use this action to upload the zip file to NexusMods as a new version of an existing file:

## Example

```yaml
- name: Zip files
  run: zip -r my-mod.zip ./dist

- name: Upload to NexusMods
  uses: Nexus-Mods/upload-action@<tag>
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.NEXUSMODS_API_KEY }}
    file_id: <file_id>
    filename: my-mod.zip
    version: 1.0.0
    category: main # optional
```

## How to find the file ID & mod ID

To get a file ID or mod ID to use in this action, you need to have created a mod page on Nexus Mods and uploaded at least one file. The IDs can be found by checking the "Advanced" option in [the Files tab of the public-facing mod page](docs/images/modpage.png), or in the [edit menu of the Manage Files page](docs/images/uploadform.png).

The File ID is labelled `Group ID` and the Mod ID is labelled `Unique Mod ID`.

## Development

### Requirements

This project requires Node v20 or higher

### Running locally

First run `npm install`, then create a `.env` file with the following required environment variables:

- `INPUT_API_KEY`
- `INPUT_FILE_ID`
- `INPUT_FILENAME`
- `INPUT_VERSION`

Optional environment variables:

- `INPUT_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `INPUT_DESCRIPTION`
- `INPUT_CATEGORY`
- `INPUT_ARCHIVE_EXISTING_VERSION`
- `INPUT_PRIMARY_MOD_MANAGER_DOWNLOAD`
- `INPUT_ALLOW_MOD_MANAGER_DOWNLOAD`
- `INPUT_SHOW_REQUIREMENTS_POP_UP`
- `INPUT_UPDATE_MOD_VERSION`
- `INPUT_MOD_ID`
- `INPUT_CHANGELOG`
- `NEXUSMODS_API_BASE` - Override the API base URL (defaults to `https://api.nexusmods.com/v3`)
- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true` - Enable debug output

Then run `npm run local-action` to build and run the action locally.

Before committing you must build the project with `npm run build`.

### OpenAPI schema

This is generated using openapi-typescript via the following command:

`npm run openapi-spec`

### Building

Run the following command to compile the TypeScript source and bundle it into `dist/index.js`:

```bash
npm run build
```

This uses Rollup with the TypeScript plugin to produce a single minified ES module bundle. The `dist/` directory must be committed, as GitHub Actions runs the bundled output directly.
